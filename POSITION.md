# POSITION

## Our Stance

wista-project takes a clear position:

Video platforms do not need to be centralized to function.

Centralization is a business decision, not a technical requirement.

---

## Neutral but Critical

This project is not anti-YouTube.
It is critical of architectural lock-in.

We acknowledge the scale and convenience of existing platforms,
while questioning whether their structure should be the default.

---

## Experiment Over Ideology

wista-project does not enforce ideology.
Instead, we prototype alternatives.

Code is the argument.
Architecture is the statement.
