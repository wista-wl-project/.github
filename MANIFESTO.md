# MANIFESTO

## Why a YouTube Alternative?

The modern web is increasingly dominated by a small number of centralized video platforms.
While convenient, this concentration creates serious problems:

- Opaque recommendation algorithms
- Forced user accounts and identity binding
- Excessive tracking and data collection
- Architectural lock-in with no inspectability

**wista-project** exists to explore alternatives.

This project is not about competing with YouTube as a business.
It is about questioning whether video on the web must be centralized at all.

## Our Position

We believe that:

- The web should remain modular, inspectable, and forkable
- Video consumption should not require platform-level lock-in
- Search, metadata, delivery, and playback should be separable concerns
- Individuals and small communities deserve usable alternatives
- Experimentation is more important than optimization for scale

WISTA is an experiment, not a replacement.

## What This Project Is

- A research-oriented web application
- A playground for alternative architectures
- A demonstration of modular video access
- An open-source experiment

---

## What This Project Is Not

- A YouTube clone
- A piracy service
- A guaranteed stable platform
- A commercial product

---

## Philosophy

Centralization is a technical choice — not an inevitability.

wista-project explores what happens when we treat video platforms
as **composable systems**, not monoliths.
